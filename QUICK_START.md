# 🚀 Kilometer Column - Quick Start Guide

## What Was Fixed?

The kilometer column wasn't working because the database schema was missing the `kilometer` field. This has been completely fixed!

## ✅ What's Included

All necessary changes have been committed:

1. ✅ Database schema updated with kilometer field
2. ✅ Storage layer includes kilometer in all rows
3. ✅ Distance calculation utilities fixed
4. ✅ Frontend calculates values correctly
5. ✅ Database migration generated
6. ✅ Type safety ensured throughout
7. ✅ Comprehensive documentation added

## 🎯 How to Use

### Step 1: Apply Database Migration

```bash
npm run db:push
```

This will add the `kilometer` column to your database.

### Step 2: Start the Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The server will start with the new kilometer functionality.

### Step 3: Test the Feature

1. Open your browser and navigate to the table page
2. You should see kilometer values automatically calculated
3. Distances are calculated from "QL Kitchen" (the warehouse)

### Step 4: Calculate Toll Prices & Update Kilometers

To populate kilometer values using Google Maps API:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/calculate-tolls \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{}'
```

Or for specific rows:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/calculate-tolls \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"rowIds": ["row-id-1", "row-id-2"]}'
```

## 📊 How It Works

### Distance Calculation

```
QL Kitchen (0.00 km)
    ↓
  Route 1 (calculates distance from QL Kitchen)
    ↓
  Route 2 (calculates cumulative distance when filtered)
    ↓
  Route 3 (and so on...)
```

- **No Filters Active**: Shows direct distance from QL Kitchen to each location
- **Filters Active**: Shows cumulative distance through the route sequence
- **Missing Coordinates**: Shows "—" for rows without lat/long

### Display Format

- QL Kitchen: `0.00 km`
- Valid Route: `12.45 km` (example)
- No Coordinates: `—`

## 🔧 Configuration

The kilometer column is configured as:

- **Editable**: No (it's calculated automatically)
- **Type**: Number (displayed as text with "km" suffix)
- **Data Source**: Calculated from latitude & longitude using Haversine formula
- **Persistence**: Saved to database in the `kilometer` column

## 📝 Key Files Changed

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `shared/schema.ts` | Database schema with kilometer field |
| `server/storage.ts` | All rows include kilometer (6 places updated) |
| `client/src/utils/distance.ts` | Fixed distance calculation logic |
| `client/src/pages/table.tsx` | Type-safe kilometer values |
| `client/src/components/data-table.tsx` | Display logic for kilometer |
| `migrations/0000_glamorous_starbolt.sql` | Database migration |

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test script:

```bash
bash /tmp/test_kilometer_fix.sh
```

Expected output: All tests should pass ✅

## 📚 Documentation

- `KILOMETER_COLUMN_FIX.md` - Detailed technical documentation
- `BEFORE_AFTER_DIAGRAM.md` - Visual before/after comparison
- `QUICK_START.md` - This guide

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### Kilometer shows "—" for all rows
- Check that rows have valid latitude and longitude values
- Ensure QL Kitchen row exists with coordinates

### Values don't persist after refresh
- Run `npm run db:push` to apply the migration
- Check that the database has the kilometer column

### TypeScript errors
- Only pre-existing `toggle-group.tsx` errors should remain
- Run `npm run check` to verify

## 🎉 Success!

If you see kilometer values in the table and they persist after refresh, everything is working correctly!
